// Sum of squares of ST*FS numbers from -mean_X (see below) to +mean_X incremented be one. For example, given ST=4 and FS=25,
// the sum consists of 100 terms: (-49.5)^2 + (-48.5)^2 + (-47.5)^2 + ... + (47.5)^2 + (48.5)^2 + (49.5)^2
// The sum is symmetrc, so you can evaluate it by multiplying its positive half by 2. It is precalcuated here for enhanced 
// performance.

#define MAX_HR 125  // Maximal heart rate. To eliminate erroneous signals, calculated HR should never be greater than this number.
#define MIN_HR 40   // Minimal heart rate. To eliminate erroneous signals, calculated HR should never be lower than this number.
// Typical heart rate. Set it to the upper value of the expected heart rate range in a given application. Obviously, it must be 
// in between MIN_HR and MAX_HR. For example, if HR in an overnight measurement varies between 46 and 65, but 90% of the time 
// stays between 50 and 60, then set it to 60.
// WARNING: This is a CRUCIAL parameter! Proper HR evaluation depends on it.

// Minimal ratio of two autocorrelation sequence elements: one at a considered lag to the one at lag 0.
// Good quality signals must have such ratio greater than this minimum.
